# pyspark-test

Fork from https://github.com/debugger24/pyspark-test

Initially this repo was intended to add minor features and open a pull request to the original repo but now the idea of this project is not testing pyspark and more extracting a diff from the pyspark. So the purpose changed from testing to debugging.
